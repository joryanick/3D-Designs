## About This Repository

These 3D models were designed using TinkerCad and printed on a Prusa MK3 with PETG filament, except for the Miqro model which was optimized for printing with TPU.

## How to Use

1. Import the `.stl` file of your choice into your favourite slicing software (e.g., PrusaSlicer, Cura, Slic3r).
2. Adjust print settings as needed for your specific printer and materials.
3. Enjoy printing!
